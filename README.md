 Is it possible to confidently predict heart disease?

### Dataset Description
-------

The Heart Disease Prediction dataset on Kaggle contains information from 270 patients who have undergone cardiac catheterizations to determine whether they have heart disease or not.

There are 13 independent variables that provide insight into potential risk factors for heart disease, including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure measurements, cholesterol levels, electrocardiogram results, exercise-induced angina symptoms, and the number of narrowed coronary arteries seen on fluoroscopy.

A target variable indicating whether each patient has heart disease or not, is also included.

This dataset provides an opportunity to analyze how these variables interact and their potential correlation with heart disease, allowing researchers and healthcare professionals to develop preventive strategies for patients at risk and improve treatment for those with heart disease.

### Project Objective and Overview
--------

Create a prediction model for heart disease using optimized machine learning algorithm .

Steps:

 1. _Perform feature selection to choose the most important variables for the prediction model._

 2. _Implement appropriate machine learning algorithm  and evaluate the model's performance in predicting heart disease._
 
 3. _Analysis results, future work suggestions._
